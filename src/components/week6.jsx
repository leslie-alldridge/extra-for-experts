      <h2>Week 6 Bonus Exercises</h2>
      <p>Week six is probably the hardest week in the entire course.</p>
      <p>
        Please push hard as this is pretty much the end of bootcamp. Following
        this you have authentication and two group projects.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Complete sweet as beers INCLUDING an admin page where you can view all
          orders that have been made. The orders should be safe and sound in a
          knex database, no longer using the data.json file.
        </li>
        <hr />
        <li>
          Once you've completed the above, delete it all and start again. Sweet
          as beers is by far the best exercise and it should be completed 2-4
          times at least.
        </li>
      </ul>
