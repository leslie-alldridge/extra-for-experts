      <p>API's! Wahoo</p>

        Before practising, you should have all exercises for the week completed.
        Following this you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use your API knowledge to learn and understand OAuth. Connect to a
          service such as Spotify, Xero, Google or Facebook.
        </li>
        <hr />
        <li>
          Create a website that hosts multiple API calls and sources. We don't
          want to go too far here, but for example a weather widget on a webpage
          where you can also view RSS feeds and control your Spotify music.
          (This would cover Weather API (easy), Reddit API (Medium) and Spotify
          API (Hard))
        </li>
      </ul>
