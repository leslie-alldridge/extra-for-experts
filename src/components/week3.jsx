      <p>Welcome to Knex</p>
      <p>
        Before practising, you should have all exercises for the week completed.
        Following this you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a project where you can complete all of the CRUD actions
          (Create, Read, Update and Delete) users from a Knex database. You can
          have an add user form, edit user form, delete user button and receive
          all users button.
        </li>
        <hr />
        <li>
          If you've completed the exercise above, you're well prepared and can
          relax now.
        </li>
        <hr />
      </ul>
